    <p id="bio">My name is Nicholas Ciambrone and I am currently studying Business Analytics
        Information & Technology at Rutgers Business School. I am currently studying at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp
        in hopes of one day creating my own website.<br><br> I had an idea for a website in highschool that I had always 
        thought would be cool, and hoped one day someone would make it. In college I was introduced to coding in
        in a class called "Computer Applications for Business", and I decided to BE the change I wanted to see in the world
        and one day create the website that I imagined in high school.<br><br> After graduating I want to be a software engineer
        and work on side projects for additional income. I hope to work at a highly regarded company like Amazon or Google.
